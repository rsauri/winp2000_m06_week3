# Learning About Linux

## Introduction
This document provides an introduction to Linux, exploring its history, a variety of available distributions, and common basic commands.

## Section 1: Linux History
**Linux** is an open-source operating system created by a Finnish computer science student, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in 1991. During that time, other operating systems were proprietary and expensive, so he wanted to create a free alternative. He released Linux under the GNU General Public License, allowing anyone to use, modify, and share the kernel and its associated code. Although Unix was a major influence and Linux drew comparisons to FreeBSD, another Unix-like system, Linux's flexible licensing model and the active contributions from its community led to its widespread adoption. As of this time, Linux has become widely used in servers and mobile devices.

## Section 2: Linux Distributions

**Linux distributions**, or **distros**, are versions of the Linux OS packaged with software and tools. They are important because they offer tailored solutions for different needs.

Here are some popular Linux distributions ideal for beginners:
- [Ubuntu](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#ubuntu)
- [Linux Mint](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#mint)
- [MX Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#mx)

These distributions are suited for advanced users, as they require a deep understanding of Linux for effective use:
- [Arch Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#arch)
- [Gentoo](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#gentoo)
- [Slackware Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#slackware)

Betweent the above distributions, the following are other popular linux distributions that can either be used by beginners or advanced users:
- [openSUSE](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#opensuse)
- [Fedora](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#fedora)
- [Debian GNU/Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#debian)
- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#redhat)
